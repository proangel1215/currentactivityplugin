### API Usage

Call **CrossCurrentActivity.Current** from any project or PCL to gain access to APIs.


**Activity**
```
/// <summary>
/// The Current Activity
/// </summary>
Activity Activity { get; set; }
```

That’s it! Well not really:

**Application Setup**
When you install this plugin a **MainApplication.cs** is installed into your android project. If you already have an Application class then you should copy over the important bits that can be found in the Readme file that was also installed in the PluginsHelp folder


**Library Creators**
Simply set this nuget as a dependency of your project to gain access to the current activity. This can be achieved by setting the following in your nuspec:

```
<dependencies>
  <group targetFramework="MonoAndroid10">
    <dependency id="Plugin.CurrentActivity" version="1.0.1"/>
  </group>
</dependencies>
```


Thanks!
